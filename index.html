                    Welcome to the landing page of Ultimate Student. A game where you are tasked to find your way through the city of 
                        Groningen and survive with only one goal.

                    <b>GRADUATION.</b>
                    <br>
                    Moving to a new Country away from all your friend's and family can be very difficult, the new language and different norms 
                        make it even more so. We created this game to help you better understand the significance of time managment in your quest to
                        graduation. Through the various tasks arrayed on the board we will help you better understand the Netherlands and specifically
                        Groningen, while getting to know your fellow player's/classmates better.
